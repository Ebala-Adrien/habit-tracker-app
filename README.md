# Habit Tracker App

## üì± About the App

### Why I Built This

I created this app to better organize my life. While searching for a habit tracker app, I couldn't find one that did everything I wanted. For me, a habit tracker is crucial as it helps manage life, increase effectiveness, and track habits. I needed an app I could adapt to my specific needs.

While this was initially a personal project, I believe it could be valuable for others too. Currently, it's not available on any app store, but if there's enough demand, I might consider publishing it there. For now, if you'd like to try it, you can either:

- Follow the guide below to set up your own instance (if you have basic programming knowledge)
- Or download the APK to test and provide feedback

### Features

A habit and task tracking application that allows you to:

- Create and manage daily habits
- Track tasks
- View progress statistics
- Completion calendar
- Streak system to maintain motivation
